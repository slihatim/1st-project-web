In this project we made a Sandwich maker called "Sandwich Fassi" where the costumor can build his own sandwich, and chooses his own drink. In the last page he'll see the final order and the total price. It's a class project in which we used some basic JS concepts such as DOM manipulation as well as some event Listeners. Made with Love by Hatim and Kssim. - [@slihatim]
